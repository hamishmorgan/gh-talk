# Emoji Reaction Semantics

**Purpose**: Standardized meanings and usage guide for GitHub's 8 supported emoji reactions.

**When to Use**: When adding reactions to comments, issues, or PRs via `gh talk react`

**Context**: GitHub supports exactly 8 emoji reactions. Use them consistently with clear semantics.

## The 8 Reactions and Their Meanings

**Use When:**
- Agreeing with a suggestion
- Confirming you'll implement feedback
- Approving a comment
- Acknowledging good point
- After fixing an issue ("Thanks, fixed!")

**Examples:**
```bash
# Reviewer suggests improvement
gh talk react PRRC_xxx 👍  # "I agree with this suggestion"

# After implementing feedback
gh talk react PRRC_xxx 👍  # "Done, thanks for the feedback"
```

**From user feedback:** Most commonly used reaction for acknowledging feedback

### ❤️ HEART - Appreciation / Thanks

**Semantic Meaning:** "Thank you" | "Appreciate this" | "Helpful" | "Love this"

**Use When:**
- Thanking for helpful review
- Appreciating detailed explanation

```

**Usage:** Keep professional, use sparingly

### 😕 CONFUSED - Unclear / Need Clarification

- Uncertain about approach

**Examples:**

🤖 Cursor"
```

**Usage:** Use sparingly, always explain in a reply

**Etiquette:** Don't use thumbs down without constructive comment

## Usage Guidelines

### When to React vs Reply

**React only:**
- Simple acknowledgment (👀, 👍)
- No explanation needed
- Quick response

**React + Reply:**
- When you need to explain (😕, 👎)
- When thanking with context (❤️)
- When celebrating with praise (🎉)

**Reply only:**
- Complex response
- Need detailed explanation
- Asking questions

### Reaction Timing

**Before addressing feedback:**
```bash
# 1. React immediately
gh talk react PRRC_xxx 👀  # "Seen"

# 2. Later, after fixing
gh talk reply PRRC_xxx "Fixed!

🤖 Cursor" --resolve --react 👍
```

**After receiving praise:**
```bash
# React to acknowledge
gh talk react PRRC_xxx ❤️  # "Thanks!"
```

### Multiple Reactions

**You can add multiple:**
```bash
gh talk react PRRC_xxx 👀  # Seen
# ... work on it ...
gh talk react PRRC_xxx 👍  # Done
# or
gh talk react PRRC_xxx 🎉  # If it's a great improvement
```

## Workflow-Specific Usage

### In PR Iteration (`/pr-iterate`)

**Standard pattern:**

```bash
# Step 1: Acknowledge
gh talk reply PRRT_xxx "👀 Looking into this

🤖 Cursor"

# Step 2: Fix

# Step 3: Confirm  
gh talk reply PRRT_xxx "Fixed!

🤖 Cursor" --resolve --react 👍
```

### In PR Review (`/pr-review`)

**Approval:**
```bash
gh talk react PRRC_xxx 👍  # Agree with change
gh talk react PRRC_xxx 🚀  # Ready to merge
```

**Feedback:**
```bash
gh talk react PRRC_xxx 😕  # Need clarification
gh talk react PRRC_xxx ❤️  # Thanks for explanation
```

### In Issue Implementation (`/issue-implement`)

**On issue:**
```bash
gh talk react I_xxx 👀     # Taking this issue
gh talk react I_xxx 🚀     # Implemented, PR created
```

**On issue comments:**
```bash
gh talk react IC_xxx 👍    # Agree with suggestion
gh talk react IC_xxx ❤️    # Thanks for input
```
