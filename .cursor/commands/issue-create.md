## Best Practices

### For Bug Reports

**Include:**

- Clear reproduction steps
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details
- Error messages (full text)
- Screenshots if applicable

**Example:**

```markdown
## Problem

`gh talk list threads` crashes when PR has >100 threads

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run: gh talk list threads --pr 123
2. PR #123 has 150 threads
3. Crashes with: panic: index out of range

## Expected

Should handle any number of threads, possibly with pagination

## Environment

- gh-talk: v0.1.0
- OS: macOS 14.0
- Go: 1.21
```

### For Feature Requests

**Include:**

- Use case (why needed)
- Proposed solution
- Alternatives considered
- Examples of usage

**Example:**

```markdown
## Feature Request

Add dry-run mode for bulk operations

## Use Case

When hiding 50 comments, want to preview before executing to avoid mistakes.

## Proposed Solution

Add --dry-run flag:
  gh talk hide --threads resolved --dry-run

Shows what would be hidden without executing.

## Alternatives

- Confirmation prompt (already exists)
- Undo command (more complex)
```
