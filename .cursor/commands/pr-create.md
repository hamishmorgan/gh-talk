# pr-create

Creating Pull Requests - complete workflow copied from rules/pr-create.mdc

See Issue #21 for duplication tracking.

**Purpose**: Workflow for creating a new PR from branch creation through initial submission.

**Prerequisites**: Git repository, gh CLI, make targets, gh-talk extension

## Agent Attribution 🤖
ALL agent content MUST include signatures:
- Commit messages: --author flag + 🤖 Generated by Cursor
- PR descriptions: End with 🤖 *Generated by Cursor*
- Comments/replies: End with 🤖 Cursor

## Steps

### 1. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b cursor_your_feature_name
```

Branch naming: cursor_feature_name (agent + underscores, NO slashes)

### 2. Make Changes
- Implement feature/fix
- Write tests (100% coverage for new code)
- Critically review your own changes

### 3. Commit Frequently
```bash
git commit --author="Cursor <cursor@noreply.local>" -m "Description

🤖 Generated by Cursor"
```
NO type prefixes, just describe what you did

### 4. Run Local Checks
```bash
make fmt && make ci
```
Required: tests pass, no linter errors, code formatted

### 5. Push
```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

### 6. Create PR
```bash
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "## Summary
...
🤖 *Generated by Cursor*"
```

### 7. Request Copilot Review
Via GitHub UI: Add "copilot" as reviewer
(Programmatic methods unreliable - see pr-iterate.mdc for details)

## Quick Reference
```bash
git checkout -b cursor_feature
make fmt && make ci
git push -u origin cursor_feature
gh pr create
```
